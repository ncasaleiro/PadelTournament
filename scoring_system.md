# Padel Tennis Scoring System (Best of 3 Sets)

## Basic Scoring System
- **Points within a game:**
  - 0 → *Love*
  - 15 → first point
  - 30 → second point
  - 40 → third point
  - Winning the fourth point (with at least 2 points advantage) → wins the **game**
- If both teams reach **40–40** → *Deuce*:
  - One team must win **two consecutive points** (Advantage → Game).

---

## Structure of a Set
- A **set** is won by the first team to reach **6 games**, with at least **2 games of difference** (e.g., 6–4).
- If the score reaches **6–6**, a **tie-break** is played:
  - Tie-break is scored numerically (1, 2, 3…).
  - First team to **7 points** (with 2-point margin) wins the tie-break → set ends **7–6**.

---

## Best of 3 Sets Format
- Matches are played as **best of 3 sets**:
  - The first team to win **2 sets** wins the match.
- Example match results:
  - 6–3, 6–4 → straight sets win.
  - 6–2, 4–6, 6–3 → deciding third set.

---

## Key Notes
- **Golden Point Rule (optional):**
  - In some tournaments, instead of “advantage” after deuce, the next point decides the game.
  - This is called the **golden point**.
- **Serving Rotation:**
  - Teams alternate serving games.
  - Within each team, players switch who serves each time their team’s turn comes.

## Super Tie-Break

The **Super Tie-break** is a variation of the normal tie-break, used to decide the third set in many tournaments.

### Super Tie-Break Characteristics

- **Points to win:** 10 points (instead of 7 in the normal tie-break)
- **Required margin:** 2-point difference to win
- **Scoring:** Numerical (0, 1, 2, 3, …), not 15/30/40
- **Wins when reaching:** 10 points with a 2-point margin (examples: 10–8, 11–9, 15–13, etc.)

### When is it used?

**In tennis:**
- In many tournaments, the third set is replaced by a super tie-break
- Commonly used in doubles (ATP, ITF, amateur tournaments) to reduce playing time

**In padel:**
- Used in various amateur tournaments or specific rules to:
  - Decide a third set
  - Speed up the tournament
- The mechanics are identical to tennis

### Difference between Normal Tie-break and Super Tie-Break

| Type | Points to win | When used |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Normal tie-break** | 7 | When score reaches 6–6 in a set |
| **Super Tie-break** | 10 | Instead of the 3rd set |

### Result Examples

- **10–8:** Valid (2-point difference)
- **10–9:** Not valid (must continue until 11–9 or more)
- **15–13:** Valid (2-point difference)

## Summary
- Points → Games → Sets → Match
- Best of 3 means you need **2 sets** to win.
- Tie-breaks settle 6–6 situations.
- **Super Tie-break** can replace the 3rd set (first to 10 with 2-point margin).
- Golden point may apply depending on the competition.
