# Padel Tennis Scoring System (Best of 3 Sets)

## Basic Scoring System
- **Points within a game:**
  - 0 → *Love*
  - 15 → first point
  - 30 → second point
  - 40 → third point
  - Winning the fourth point (with at least 2 points advantage) → wins the **game**
- If both teams reach **40–40** → *Deuce*:
  - One team must win **two consecutive points** (Advantage → Game).

---

## Structure of a Set
- A **set** is won by the first team to reach **6 games**, with at least **2 games of difference** (e.g., 6–4).
- If the score reaches **6–6**, a **tie-break** is played:
  - Tie-break is scored numerically (1, 2, 3…).
  - First team to **7 points** (with 2-point margin) wins the tie-break → set ends **7–6**.

---

## Best of 3 Sets Format
- Matches are played as **best of 3 sets**:
  - The first team to win **2 sets** wins the match.
- Example match results:
  - 6–3, 6–4 → straight sets win.
  - 6–2, 4–6, 6–3 → deciding third set.

---

## Key Notes
- **Golden Point Rule (optional):**
  - In some tournaments, instead of “advantage” after deuce, the next point decides the game.
  - This is called the **golden point**.
- **Serving Rotation:**
  - Teams alternate serving games.
  - Within each team, players switch who serves each time their team’s turn comes.

---

## Summary
- Points → Games → Sets → Match
- Best of 3 means you need **2 sets** to win.
- Tie-breaks settle 6–6 situations.
- Golden point may apply depending on the competition.
